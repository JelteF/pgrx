/// Get a unique pointer for a thread.
///
/// Conceptually, you can imagine that this returns a pointer to a thread local.
/// Unfortunately, under the TLS model relevant for pgx code (the global-dynamic
/// TLS model, which must be used by code that in modules that expect to be
/// dynamically loaded), actually accessing thread locals requires some hoops
/// that the C runtime must jump through -- calling `_tlv_bootstrap` (on Mach-O
/// targets), or `__tls_get_addr` (on ELF targets).
///
/// This is pretty fast, but we can make the check essentially free by using the
/// [similar] [tricks] to those used by thread-pooling allocators to detect
/// cross-thread frees.
///
/// Specifically, we don't need the pointer to any *particular* thread-local,
/// just a pointer that is guaranteed to be unique to the thread. This means we
/// can return any thread-specific pointer accessable through userspace such as
/// thread control/environment blocks, the TLS base pointer, etc. On many
/// targets, these can be accessed via inline assembly.
///
/// The details of doing this is... Very platform specific, to say the least. We
/// implement this for four targets
/// (`{x86_64,aarch64}`-`{apple-darwin,unknown-linux-gnu}`), rather than try to
/// implement it everywhere. It would be easy to add a few more (32-bit x86,
/// windows), but at the moment these are either unimportant to us, or
/// unsupported.
///
/// We explicitly exclude non-glibc toolchains on linux (although musl seems to
/// use the same conventions), and avoid builds under the x32 ABI (32-bit
/// pointers under x86_64). This mostly to reduce the cost of maintaining some
/// especially target-specific inline assembly. The approaches we take are as
/// follows:
///
/// - On x86_64 linux, we use `fs:0`, as `fs` is the thread register (which we
///   can't directly read from userspace), and (at least under glibc) the TCB is
///   in the first slot.
///
/// - On x86_64 macOS, we use `gs:0` -- same as above, but it uses `gs` for the
///   thread register.
///
/// - On aarch64 linux we read from the `tpidr_el0` system register, which holds
///   the thread base (no need to load the first address).
///
/// - On aarch64 macOS, we read from the `tpidrro_el0` system register (e.g. the
///   readonly version of the one aarch64 linux uses).
///
/// - As a fallback, we use the address of a thread-local.
///
/// If we care to support other linuxes, we can check the
/// [`llvm.thread.pointer`], but it should be both tested and manually verified
/// that it matches what e.g. glibc stores at that location -- at least
/// currently (in 2022) it seems to usually silently return the wrong result.
